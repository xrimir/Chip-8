#Chip-8 Interpreter

###Todo:
- detach cpu frequency from timer's frequency
- add sound (it's already added, but I need to pick sound type)
- optimize performance (regarding first todo item) some games are less playable than others (like space invaders).
Most of the games run flawlessly (pong, brix etc.)
